Understanding CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements to which styles can be applied.
They act as a way to identify and address elements based on their various characteristics.

Types of CSS
1.Element Selector: Targets elements based on their tag name.
    -Example: h1 targets all <h1> elements.
2.Class Selector: Targets elements based on their class attribute.
    -Example: .special targets all elements with the class attribute "special".
3.ID Selector: Targets a single element based on its ID attribute.
    -Example: #myElement targets the element with the ID "myElement".
4.Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attributes.
    +Examples:
    -[href] targets all elements with an href attribute.
    -[type="button"] targets all elements with the type attribute set to "button".
5.Pseudo-Class Selector: Targets elements based on their state or condition.
    +Examples:
    -:hover targets an element when the mouse hovers over it.
    -:active targets an element when it is clicked.
