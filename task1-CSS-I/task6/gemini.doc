Styling Text and Fonts with CSS
CSS provides a wide range of properties for customizing the appearance of text, including fonts, size, weight, color, and alignment.

Common Text Properties
font-family: Specifies the font to be used.
font-size: Sets the size of the text.
font-weight: Defines the boldness of the text (e.g., normal, bold, lighter, bolder).
text-align: Specifies the alignment of the text within its container (e.g., left, center, right, justify).
color: Sets the color of the text.
text-decoration: Applies decorations to the text (e.g., underline, line-through).
Example HTML and CSS

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Text Styling Example</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }

    h1 {
      font-size: 36px;
      font-weight: bold;
      text-align: center;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 18px;
      line-height: 1.5;
    }

    a {
      color: blue;
      text-decoration: underline;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <p>This is another paragraph with <a href="#">a link</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Explanation
The body selector sets the default font family for the entire page.
The h1 selector styles the heading with a larger font size, bold weight, and center alignment.
The p selector styles paragraphs with a specific font size and line height.
The a selector styles links with a blue color and an underline.
By combining these properties, you can create a wide range of text styles to match your design requirements.
