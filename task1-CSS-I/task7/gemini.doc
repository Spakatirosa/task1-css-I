Online Fonts
Online fonts, also known as web fonts, are font files that are hosted on a server and can be accessed by websites. This allows you to use a wider variety of fonts on your website without requiring users to install them locally.

Integrating Online Fonts:

Choose a Font Provider: There are many online font providers, such as Google Fonts, Typekit, and Adobe Fonts.
Select Fonts: Browse the provider's library and select the fonts you want to use.
Embed the Fonts: Follow the provider's instructions to embed the fonts into your website's HTML code. This typically involves adding a <link> tag to the <head> section of your HTML document.
Using Google Fonts in HTML
Here's an example of how to use Google Fonts in an HTML document:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:400,700" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  </body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

In this example, we're using the Roboto font from Google Fonts. The rel="stylesheet" attribute indicates that the link is to a stylesheet.

Favicons
A favicon is a small image that appears in the browser's tab or address bar, representing your website. It helps users identify your site and can improve brand recognition.

Adding a Favicon:

Create a Favicon: Design or find a suitable image for your favicon. It's typically a square image, often 16x16 or 32x32 pixels.
Save the Image: Save the image in a format like .ico, .png, or .gif.
Add to Your HTML: Place the following code in the <head> section of your HTML document:
HTML
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
Use code with caution.

Replace favicon.ico with the actual filename and path to your favicon image.

By using online fonts and favicons, you can enhance the visual appeal and branding of your website, making it more memorable and professional.
