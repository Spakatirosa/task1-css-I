CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, design, and overall visual appearance of web pages.

HTML Code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CSS Basics Example</title>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: lightblue;
            color: darkblue;
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple example demonstrating CSS basics.</p>
</body>
</html>
Breakdown of HTML Elements
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document as an HTML5 document, ensuring the browser renders it in standards mode.

<html lang="en">: The root element of the HTML document. The lang attribute specifies the language of the document (English in this case).

<head>: Contains meta-information about the document.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Sets the character encoding for the document to UTF-8, which supports most characters and symbols.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures the page is responsive and scales correctly on different devices by setting the viewport width and initial scale.
<title>: Sets the title of the web page that appears in the browser tab.
<style>: Contains internal CSS that styles the document.

<body>: Contains the content that will be displayed on the webpage.

<h1>: A heading element that displays "Welcome to My Website."
<p>: A paragraph element containing text that explains the example.
Breakdown of CSS Code
Inside the <style> tag:
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
    color: darkblue;
    font-size: 20px;
}
body { ... }: This selector targets the <body> element of the HTML document.

background-color: lightblue;: Sets the background color of the body to light blue. This color will fill the entire background of the webpage.

color: darkblue;: Sets the default text color for the body (and therefore for the <h1> and <p> elements) to dark blue.

font-size: 20px;: Sets the default font size for the text in the body to 20 pixels.
