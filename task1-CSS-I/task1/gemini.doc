Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written 
in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
