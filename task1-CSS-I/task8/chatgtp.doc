Online fonts (or web fonts) are fonts that are hosted on external servers and loaded into a website using CSS. These fonts allow web developers to use a wide variety of typefaces without needing the user to have them installed on their local machine. The most common service for integrating online fonts is Google Fonts, which provides free and easy-to-implement fonts for web design.

Integrating Google Fonts into a Website
Google Fonts provides a wide range of free fonts that can be easily added to any website. To use Google Fonts:

Choose a font from the Google Fonts library.
Link the font in the HTML document using a <link> tag or via the @import rule in CSS.
Example: Using Google Fonts
Let's add a Google Font called Roboto to an HTML document.

Step 1: Include the Google Fonts Link
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Google Fonts Example</title>
    <!-- Google Fonts Link -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
        }
        h1 {
            font-weight: 700; /* Using the bold version of the font */
        }
        p {
            font-weight: 400; /* Using the regular version of the font */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is an example of using the Google Font 'Roboto'.</p>
</body>
</html>
Explanation:
The <link> tag imports the Roboto font from Google Fonts.
The font-family property is applied to the body element, and it specifies that Roboto should be used for all text on the page. The fallback is sans-serif.
Different font weights (400 for normal and 700 for bold) are used for the heading and paragraph elements.
What is a Favicon?
A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small icon that represents a website, typically displayed in the browser tab next to the page title. Favicons help users quickly identify a webpage and give a professional look to a website.

Favicons are usually square images, often 16x16 or 32x32 pixels, but modern browsers support multiple sizes, including higher resolutions for retina displays.

Adding a Favicon to a Web Page
To add a favicon to a webpage, follow these steps:

Create or download an image for your favicon. You can use formats like .ico, .png, or .svg.
Add the favicon to your website using the <link> element in the <head> section of your HTML document.
Example: Adding a Favicon
Save your favicon image as favicon.ico or another appropriate format.
Add the following HTML to your document:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Favicon Example</title>
    <!-- Favicon Link -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Favicon Example</h1>
    <p>Check the browser tab to see the favicon.</p>
</body>
</html>
Explanation:
The <link rel="icon"> tag is used to define the favicon for the webpage. The href attribute points to the location of the favicon file.
The type attribute specifies the file type, in this case, image/x-icon for .ico files. You can also use other image formats like .png by changing the type.
