+Debugging CSS Using Browser Developer Tools
1. Inspect Elements:

Right-click on an element in the browser and select "Inspect" or use the developer tools shortcut (e.g., F12 in Chrome).
This will open the developer tools, allowing you to examine the HTML structure and CSS styles applied to the element.
2. Identify CSS Problems:

Check for Conflicting Styles: Look for multiple rules targeting the same element. Inspect the styles to see if they conflict.
Verify Syntax: Ensure there are no typos or errors in the CSS code.
Examine Specificity: Use the developer tools to check the specificity of CSS rules and identify which rules are taking precedence.
Test Browser Compatibility: Use multiple browsers to test for inconsistencies in how the CSS is rendered.
3. Test Changes Live:

-Modify the CSS directly in the developer tools' styles panel.
-The changes will be reflected immediately in the browser, allowing you to see the effects of your modifications in real-time.
